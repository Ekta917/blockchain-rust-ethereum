Just a test project to work with Ethereum but using Rust.

Quick note if you want to run this project on your system.

1. You need Rust installed
2. You need Ganache installed globally

Clone this repo, `cd` into it and then -

There are two separate files that can be compiled into different binaries, so you run either of the below commands - 

``` bash
cargo run --bin transact
cargo run --bin deploy
```
Depending on the option you pass after `--bin`, the particular binary will run.
